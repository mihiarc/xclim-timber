- **Limited by cool temperatures** more than frost

**Southeast:**
- Frost-free season: 322 days (lengthening)
- Growing degree days: 2,673 ¬∞C¬∑days
- **More heat stress risk** for sensitive species

### Forest Management Implications

1. **Extended Growing Seasons**
   - Longer periods for tree growth
   - Earlier spring green-up
   - Later fall dormancy

2. **Increased Heat Stress**
   - Southeast forests experiencing more extreme heat
   - Pacific Northwest seeing emergence of heat extremes
   - Potential impacts on tree physiology and survival

3. **Shifting Frost Patterns**
   - Decreasing frost frequency
   - Changes in hardening/dehardening cycles
   - Potential for false springs

4. **Water Stress**
   - More growing degree days = higher evaporative demand
   - Increased risk during heat waves
   - Southeast particularly vulnerable

## üîç Notable Climate Differences

### Temperature Extremes

**Pacific Northwest is characterized by:**
- Moderate temperatures year-round
- Significant frost exposure
- Rare heat waves
- High daily temperature variability

**Southeast is characterized by:**
- High summer temperatures
- Minimal frost exposure
- Frequent heat waves
- Lower daily temperature variability
- Substantial tropical night occurrence

### Climate Change Vulnerability

**Pacific Northwest:**

- **Opportunity:** Extended growing season with minimal heat stress

**Southeast:**
- **Vulnerability:** Intensifying heat waves
- **Risk:** Heat stress already common, getting worse
- **Opportunity:** Minimal frost limitation for year-round growth

## üéØ Key Takeaways

### For Forest Management

1. **Climate Change is Observable and Significant**
   - Both regions show robust warming trends
   - Changes are accelerating (more rapid in recent years)
   - Impacts differ by region but both experiencing change

2. **Regional Differences Matter**
   - Pacific Northwest: Temperate, frost-limited
   - Southeast: Subtropical, heat-stressed
   - Management strategies must be region-specific

3. **Extreme Events Increasing**
   - Heat waves becoming more frequent (esp. Southeast)
   - Frost events decreasing but still significant (esp. Pacific Northwest)
   - Growing season lengthening in both regions

### For Climate Adaptation Planning

1. **Temperature Increases Are Consistent**
   - ~0.75-1.2¬∞C over 44 years
   - Projected to continue under most scenarios
   - Species selection should account for warmer conditions

2. **Heat Extremes Are the New Normal**
   - Southeast: Heat waves now occur 2-3x per year
   - Pacific Northwest: Emergence of previously rare heat events
   - Infrastructure and management plans need updating

3. **Growing Season Extension**
   - Longer frost-free periods
   - More accumulated heat
   - Opportunities for expanded growing periods
   - Risks of false spring events
